	Description: Defines all custom AI spawns here. Note that you must first define a custom spawn area
	by creating an area marker in the appropriate file in the custom_markers folder.

		2, 						//This trigger will spawn a group of 2 AI units.
		1,						//Weapon grade setting. 1 = weapon chosen from Military loot table (see below for explanation of Weapon Grade)
		true					//(OPTIONAL)* Respawn setting. True: AI spawned will respawn (Default). False: AI will not respawn. Spawn area will be deleted when all units have been killed.
	] call DZAI_spawn_units;
	
	The above DZAI_spawn_units call will create 2 respawning AI units with weapons from DayZ's military loot table.

		"dzaicustomspawntest",	//This is the marker name to be used as the patrol and spawning area.
		"ArmoredSUV_PMC_DZ",	//Insert a vehicle classname here. Acceptable vehicle types: Air or Land vehicles. Spawn will be cancelled if classname is invalid or banned.
		[3,1],					//Set number of passenger and gunner units here. A driver unit will always be created. DZAI will not add more units to a vehicle than the vehicle type allows. Only land vehicles may have passenger units.
		1,						//Weapon grade setting. 1 = weapon chosen from Military loot table (see below for explanation of Weapon Grade)
		true,					//(OPTIONAL)* Respawn setting. True: AI will respawn with vehicle after a specified time. False: AI and vehicle will not respawn after being destroyed. (Default)
		600						//(OPTIONAL)* Respawn time. Number of seconds to wait until AI and vehicle are respawned. (Default: 600). Timer begins after AI group is wiped out or vehicle is destroyed, whichever comes first.
	] call DZAI_spawn_vehicle;
	
	The above DZAI_spawn_vehicle call will spawn an Armored SUV with 1 driver, 3 passenger units and 1 gunner unit with military-grade weapons, and will respawn after 600 seconds (3 minutes).

	* Optional parameters may be left out of the function call. A default action will be taken instead.
	
	Weapon Grade explanation:
	
	0: Approx 40% of maximum AI skill potential - weapon from Farm/Residential loot table.
	1: Approx 55% of maximum AI skill potential - weapon from Military loot table
	2: Approx 70% of maximum AI skill potential - weapon from MilitarySpecial (Barracks) loot table
	3: Approx 80% of maximum AI skill potential - weapon from HeliCrash loot table
